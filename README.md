# toyHttpServer
This is a toy HTTP server project developed by c++. In this project, we determine the content sent to the client by parsing string. While getting the "GET" command, 
the server would send the following "GetRespo" page to the client

Clicking the "2Post" button, the "POST" command would be sent and the server will respond by sending the following "PostRespo" page to the client

We would return to the "GetRespo" page if we click the "2Get" button on the page.
